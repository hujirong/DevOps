# This file demonstrate the usage of ConfigFile
# This is enhanced version of Java Properties
#
# Suppose you define instance of ConfigFile
#
# ConfigFile conf = new ConfigFile('conf/confmgr.properties')
#

# Get user:
#    conf.getConfig('user')
# Which returns the user value
#
user=

# To use password, you define either 
#    password=mypassod
# Or
#    password_PasswordID=5544
#    password_APIKey=3323232334
#
# You get PasswordID and APIKey from PasswordState
#

# Scenario 1:
# Define password in clear text, and call
#    conf.getConfig('password', true)
# Which returns the password value, and also encrypt the password value
# in the property file
#
# In the next call, the ConfigFile class will use the encrypted value
password=mypassod

# Scenario 2:
# In this case, you define passwordID and APIKey in clear text, and call
#    conf.getConfig('password2', true)
# The ConfigFile class will call PasswordState with passwordID and APIKey,
# and returns the value in PasswordState, and the class also encrypt
# the APIKey
#
# In the next call, the ConfigFile class will use the encrypted APIKey

password2_PasswordID=5544
password2_APIKey=3323232334
